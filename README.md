# cicerone_project

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The Flutter application for this project combines technologies like Firebase for data storage, a custom indoor museum map created in RIVE, and Dijkstra's algorithm for route planning. It allows users to navigate seamlessly within an indoor museum, offering a visually appealing interface and efficient pathfinding. Users can easily download the app by scanning a QR code, enhancing their museum experience.
